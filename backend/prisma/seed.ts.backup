      content: `# Getting Started with Cardano Development

Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform that enables developers to build secure and scalable decentralized applications. In this guide, we'll explore the essential tools and concepts you need to begin your Cardano development journey.

## Setting Up Your Environment

First, you'll need to set up your development environment. This includes installing the Cardano node, setting up a wallet, and familiarizing yourself with the Cardano CLI.

### Required Tools

- **Cardano Node**: The core component that connects to the Cardano network
- **Cardano CLI**: Command-line interface for interacting with the blockchain
- **Plutus Platform**: Smart contract development framework
- **Cardano Wallet**: For managing ADA and tokens

## Understanding the Cardano Architecture

Cardano uses a unique two-layer architecture:

1. **Cardano Settlement Layer (CSL)**: Handles ADA transactions
2. **Cardano Computation Layer (CCL)**: Executes smart contracts

This separation allows for greater flexibility and security in the platform.

## Your First Smart Contract

Let's write a simple validator in Plutus:

\`\`\`haskell
{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}

module SimpleValidator where

import PlutusTx
import PlutusTx.Prelude

simpleValidator :: () -> () -> ScriptContext -> Bool
simpleValidator _ _ _ = True

validator :: Validator
validator = mkValidatorScript $$(PlutusTx.compile [|| simpleValidator ||])
\`\`\`

## Next Steps

- Explore the Cardano documentation
- Join the developer community
- Build your first dApp
- Contribute to open-source projects

Happy coding on Cardano!`,

      content: `# Understanding Cardano Staking Mechanisms

Cardano's Ouroboros protocol is a groundbreaking proof-of-stake consensus mechanism that allows ADA holders to participate in network security and earn rewards.

## What is Staking?

Staking is the process of delegating your ADA to a stake pool, which then validates transactions and produces blocks on the Cardano blockchain.

## Benefits of Staking

- **Passive Income**: Earn approximately 4-5% annual returns
- **Network Security**: Help secure the Cardano network
- **No Lock-up**: Your ADA remains liquid
- **Low Barrier**: Start with any amount of ADA

## How to Stake

1. Choose a reliable wallet (Daedalus, Yoroi, etc.)
2. Select a stake pool based on performance metrics
3. Delegate your ADA
4. Start earning rewards after 15-20 days

## Stake Pool Selection Criteria

When choosing a stake pool, consider:

- Pool performance and reliability
- Saturation level
- Pool operator reputation
- Fee structure
- Mission alignment

Staking is one of the easiest ways to support the Cardano ecosystem while earning passive rewards!`,

      content: `# Building Decentralized Applications on Cardano

The Cardano ecosystem offers powerful tools for building secure and scalable decentralized applications (dApps). This guide will walk you through the process.

## Architecture Overview

A typical Cardano dApp consists of:

1. **Smart Contracts**: Written in Plutus (Haskell)
2. **Frontend**: JavaScript/TypeScript with Cardano libraries
3. **Wallet Integration**: Using CIP-30 standard
4. **Backend** (optional): Off-chain services

## Essential Libraries

- **@meshsdk/core**: Comprehensive SDK for Cardano
- **cardano-serialization-lib**: Low-level transaction building
- **lucid-cardano**: Lightweight, easy-to-use library
- **@emurgo/cardano-serialization-lib-browser**: WebAssembly bindings

## Development Workflow

\`\`\`typescript
import { BrowserWallet } from '@meshsdk/core';

// Connect to user's wallet
const wallet = await BrowserWallet.enable('eternl');

// Get wallet balance
const balance = await wallet.getBalance();

// Build and submit transaction
const tx = await wallet.createTx()
  .sendLovelace(
    'addr1...',
    '1000000'
  )
  .build();

const signed = await wallet.signTx(tx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signed);
\`\`\`

## Best Practices

- Always validate user inputs
- Handle wallet disconnections gracefully
- Implement proper error handling
- Test thoroughly on testnet first
- Use TypeScript for type safety

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for smart contracts
- Integration tests for wallet interactions
- End-to-end tests for user flows
- Security audits before mainnet deployment

## The EUTXO Advantage

Cardano's Extended UTXO model provides inherent security benefits:
- Deterministic execution
- Parallel transaction processing
- Local state management
- Predictable fees

## Common Vulnerabilities

### 1. Insufficient Validation
Always validate all inputs and datum fields.

\`\`\`haskell
validator :: Datum -> Redeemer -> ScriptContext -> Bool
validator datum redeemer ctx = 
    traceIfFalse "Invalid datum" (validDatum datum) &&
    traceIfFalse "Invalid redeemer" (validRedeemer redeemer) &&
    traceIfFalse "Invalid context" (validContext ctx)
\`\`\`

### 2. Integer Overflow
Use safe arithmetic operations.

### 3. Front-running
Design protocols resistant to MEV attacks.

## Formal Verification

Cardano enables formal verification:
- Mathematical proofs of correctness
- Automated theorem proving
- Property-based testing
- Model checking

## Testing Strategy

\`\`\`haskell
-- Property-based testing with QuickCheck
prop_validatorAlwaysSucceeds :: Datum -> Redeemer -> ScriptContext -> Bool
prop_validatorAlwaysSucceeds d r c = validator d r c == True

-- Unit tests
testValidator :: TestTree
testValidator = testCase "Validator accepts valid input" $
    validator validDatum validRedeemer validContext @?= True
\`\`\`

## Audit Checklist

- [ ] All inputs validated
- [ ] Safe arithmetic used
- [ ] No hardcoded values
- [ ] Proper error handling
- [ ] Access control implemented
- [ ] Time locks verified
- [ ] Comprehensive tests
- [ ] Formal verification (where possible)

## Third-Party Audits

        'Learn how to minimize transaction costs while building applications on the Cardano blockchain.',
      content: `# Optimizing Transaction Fees on Cardano

Understanding and optimizing transaction fees is crucial for building cost-effective applications on Cardano.

## Fee Structure

Cardano fees consist of:
- **Base fee**: Constant component (~0.15 ADA)
- **Size fee**: Based on transaction size (~0.000044 ADA per byte)

Formula: \`fee = a + b × size\`

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Minimize Transaction Size

\`\`\`typescript
// Inefficient: Multiple outputs
const tx1 = createTx()
  .sendLovelace(addr1, '1000000')
  .sendLovelace(addr2, '1000000')
  .sendLovelace(addr3, '1000000');

// Better: Batch where possible
const tx2 = createTx()
  .sendAssets([
    { address: addr1, lovelace: '1000000' },
    { address: addr2, lovelace: '1000000' },
    { address: addr3, lovelace: '1000000' }
  ]);
\`\`\`

### 2. UTXO Management

- Consolidate small UTXOs
- Avoid UTXO fragmentation
- Use optimal change addresses

### 3. Metadata Optimization

Only include essential metadata:

\`\`\`typescript
// Avoid large metadata
const metadata = {
  // Keep it minimal
  version: '1.0',
  timestamp: Date.now()
};
\`\`\`

## Batching Transactions

Process multiple operations in a single transaction:

\`\`\`typescript
const batchTx = await wallet
  .createTx()
  .mintAsset(nft1)
  .mintAsset(nft2)
  .sendAssets(distribution)
  .build();
\`\`\`

## Off-Chain Processing

Move computation off-chain where possible:
- Calculate complex logic in your backend
- Use oracles for external data
- Implement state channels for frequent interactions

## Upcoming Improvements

**Hydra State Channels**: Near-zero fees
**Mithril**: Faster, cheaper chain sync
**Input Endorsers**: Better UTXO selection

## Cost Comparison

| Operation | Typical Fee |
|-----------|-------------|
| Simple send | 0.17 ADA |
| Token transfer | 0.20 ADA |
| NFT mint | 0.25 ADA |
| Smart contract | 0.30-1.00 ADA |

## Monitoring Fees

Track your application's fee efficiency:
- Log all transaction costs
- Analyze fee patterns
- Optimize high-cost operations
- Set fee budgets

        'Step-by-step guide to creating your own native token on Cardano, from minting to distribution.',
      content: `# Building a Token on Cardano: Complete Tutorial

Creating native tokens on Cardano is straightforward and doesn't require smart contracts. This tutorial will guide you through the entire process.

## Why Native Tokens?

Cardano treats custom tokens as first-class citizens:
- No smart contract needed
- Same security as ADA
- Lower fees than ERC-20
- Built-in metadata support

## Prerequisites

- Cardano wallet with ADA
- Basic JavaScript/TypeScript knowledge
- Node.js installed

## Method 1: Using Mesh SDK

\`\`\`typescript
import { MeshWallet, AssetMetadata } from '@meshsdk/core';

const wallet = new MeshWallet({
  networkId: 1, // mainnet
  key: {
    type: 'mnemonic',
    words: [...] // your seed phrase
  }
});

// Define token metadata
const metadata: AssetMetadata = {
  name: 'MyToken',
  ticker: 'MTK',
  description: 'My awesome token',
  decimals: 6,
  totalSupply: '1000000000000' // 1 million tokens
};

// Mint the token
const tx = await wallet.mintAsset({
  assetName: 'MyToken',
  quantity: '1000000000000',
  metadata: metadata
});

const signed = await wallet.signTx(tx);
const txHash = await wallet.submitTx(signed);
console.log(\`Token minted! TxHash: \${txHash}\`);
\`\`\`

## Method 2: Using Cardano CLI

\`\`\`bash
# Generate policy keys
cardano-cli address key-gen \\
    --verification-key-file policy.vkey \\
    --signing-key-file policy.skey

# Create policy script
cat > policy.script <<EOF
{
  "type": "all",
  "scripts": [
    {
      "type": "before",
      "slot": 50000000
    },
    {
      "type": "sig",
      "keyHash": "$(cardano-cli address key-hash --payment-verification-key-file policy.vkey)"
    }
  ]
}
EOF

# Build minting transaction
cardano-cli transaction build \\
    --tx-in <UTXO> \\
    --tx-out <YOUR_ADDRESS>+<AMOUNT>+"1000000 <POLICY_ID>.MyToken" \\
    --mint="1000000 <POLICY_ID>.MyToken" \\
    --minting-script-file policy.script \\
    --metadata-json-file metadata.json \\
    --change-address <YOUR_ADDRESS> \\
    --out-file matx.raw
\`\`\`

## Token Metadata

Create a metadata.json file:

\`\`\`json
{
  "721": {
    "<POLICY_ID>": {
      "MyToken": {
        "name": "MyToken",
        "ticker": "MTK",
        "description": "My awesome token",
        "decimals": 6,
        "url": "https://mytoken.io",
        "logo": "data:image/png;base64,..."
      }
    }
  }
}
\`\`\`

## Distribution Strategies

### Airdrop
\`\`\`typescript
const recipients = ['addr1...', 'addr2...', 'addr3...'];
const amountPerWallet = '1000000'; // 1 token

const tx = await wallet.createTx();
for (const addr of recipients) {
  tx.sendAssets(addr, [
    { unit: policyId + tokenName, quantity: amountPerWallet }
  ]);
}
\`\`\`
